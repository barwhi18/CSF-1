Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)


Problem 2:

python dna_analysis.py data/test-small.fastq 
GC-content: 0.3

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq 
GC-content: 0.43029262963

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_2.fastq 
GC-content: 0.451051333333

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_3.fastq 
GC-content: 0.646864112524

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_4.fastq 
GC-content: 0.347852341166

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_5.fastq 
GC-content: 0.263157894737

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_6.fastq 
GC-content: 0.491518518519


Problem 3:
>>> After commenting out seq and linenum:
== python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

>>> seq = all the nucleotides in the input file that have been read so far 
and linenum = the current line number === if they are commented out the program
does not know what they were initially defined as and can therefore not run...

>>> After reinstating seq and linenum and commenting out gc_count=0:
== python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 66, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

>>>By commenting out gc_count when the program wants to print gc_content 
(which is defined as: gc_content = float(gc_count) / total_count) the program 
is unable to print gc_content if gc_count is undefined...

Collaboration:

Whitney Barber and I collaborated! 

Reflection:

This assignment took me about 1 hour to complete. 
Loops! Functions! Arguments! 
I had a bit of trouble getting started but once I understood that I was to 
run the program using iTerm I was able to get going. 
Use iTerm! Make sure you remember to uncomment-out your commented-out things!
And remember that you need to define at again after the cg loop is over!
