Problem 3 Nested Data Structures

Sets, tuples, and dictionaries are all types of data structures.  They can be used individually and can be
'nested' inside of eachother.  For example, you can have a dictionary containing a list.

"A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by
integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples
are immutable.
A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a
dictionary they can be (almost) any type.
You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys)
and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called
a key-value pair or sometimes an item." - Think Python
A set can store certain values without any particular order and no repeated values.

Data structure indicators:
set = set[1,2,3]
tuple = (  )
dictionary = {  }

Practice making individual data structures:
  Make a tuple.
  Make a set.
  Make a dictionary.
  
Now, practice making nested data structures:
  Make a set containing a dictionary.
  Make a set containing a tuple.
  Make a set containing a dictionary that contains a set.


Problem 4 'for' and 'if' statements

"The syntax of a 'for' statement is similar to a function deﬁnition. It has a header that ends
with a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements.
A for statement is sometimes called a loop because the ﬂow of execution runs through the
body and then loops back to the top."

Example of a 'for' statement:

n = 25
x = 0
for i in range(n):
  x = x + i
  print x
  
Practice making a 'for' loop:
Assign a variable to some number. Use a 'for' statement to indicate the range of that variable.  Have another variable, 
which you identify before the 'for' statement.  Increase your second variable by the range of your first (add x+1, 
x+2,... x+n).


Problem 5 Definitions

""A function deﬁnition speciﬁes the name of a new function and the
sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

Here is an example:
def print_lyrics():
  print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay."
  print "I sleep all night and I work all day."
  
def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function deﬁnition. The name of the function
is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,
numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the ﬁrst character can’t be a number.
You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable
and a function with the same name.
The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments.
The ﬁrst line of the function deﬁnition is called the header; the rest is called the body.
The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the
indentation is always four spaces (see Section 3.14). The body can contain any number of
statements.""

Practice:
Define a function that, when called, prints your full name, first, middle, and last - each on separate lines. 

Problem 6 Assert
An 'assert' call means everything that follows is Boolean (True or False). 'Assert' helps to fix bugs in your program by 
confirming that all that should be true is, and if not, gives you an 'assertion error'.
After you define a function, you can use the 'assert' to confirm that the function is working correctly.  Here is an
example of both defining a function and using 'assert'.
The following example uses data from files within the folder, hw5.html.
FILE 1:
def row_to_edge(row):
    """
    Given an election result row or poll data row, returns the Democratic edge
    in that state.
    """
    return float(row["Dem"]) - float(row["Rep"])  

FILE 2:
def test_row_to_edge():
    row1 = { "Dem": 5, "Rep": 90 }
    assert row_to_edge(row1) == -85

    row2 = { "Dem": 57.5, "Rep": 77.5 }
    assert row_to_edge(row2) == -20

    row3 = { "Dem": 52, "Rep": 49, "Lib": 1 }
    assert row_to_edge(row3) == 3
    
The definition, row_to_edge, in File 1 is written such that the assert statements are true.
